## 1. Save the world

You are a young computer scientist who is a assigned to maintain an old
computation complex Wahnsinn-X. It is still being used by military forces to
predict and prevent a nuclear threat on the planet. You don't even want to think
about possible consequences of the "prevention".

It was your regular maintenance procedure, when you have noticed a cat
suspiciosly looking at a cup of coffee forgotten by your colleague earlier this
morning. The cat pushed the cup with its paw, it falls down and the remaining
coffee splashes on the motherboard of Wanshinn-X. The next moment you hear the
sirens, see the red lights and the armored nuclear proof shields ceales the room
closed.

You grab your phone and quickly create a filtering bridge between Wahsinn-X and
the upstream socket. You always keep your favorite code editor at your finger
tips so it didn't take any time to setup your facorite coding environment and
start observing.

The complex consists of various sensors that generate positive integer numbers.
But because of the short circuit, Whansinn-X has started to generate false
signals which seem to be always odd numbers followed by 4 or 2 in the output.
E.g. `34` or `72` actually should be just `4` or `2`.

Write a program in the folder `filter-digits` that accepts integer numbers,
filters out invalid digits and outputs the correct number. Since you are a great
engineer, writing tested code and ensuring all representative cases are covered
by the tests is in your blood. It also guarantees you program works correctly
and the world is actually saved.

You don't have much time left! The world's safety is in your hands!
